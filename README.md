This is my first major project in Angular, begun as a student at the Midland University Code Academy.  It utilizes Angular 9, ngrx/store, and design elements from Angular Material and Bootstrap.  It queries Major League Baseball statistics from the MLB Advanced Media API and displays them like a contemporary sports website, ranging from team and transaction information to player statistics.   

This repository is the 1.0 version of this application.  It utilizes Angular, node.js and express.js alongside a postgreSQL database.   Other than incorporating the relational database over a MongoDB database, it demonstrates the MEAN development stack.   

This application was re-factored into an enterprise environment utilizing a .NET Core 3.1 backend, OAuth 2.0 authentication provider and a service worker.   That version of the application may be found at https://github.com/mikejunt/mlbAngular.

The information and statistics presented within this application are either sourced directly or derived from other information received via the Major League Baseball API distributed by MLB Advanced Media and are subject to their copyright terms found at http://gdx.mlb.com/components/copyright.txt.
